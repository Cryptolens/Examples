# Unity

Since Unity uses Mono, [specially build binaries](https://github.com/cryptolens/cryptolens-dotnet#compatibility) of Cryptolens.Licensing need to be used in order for it to work.
These binaries can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/Cryptolens/cryptolens-dotnet/releases). **Note**, you need to use those that
are in "Without System.Management" folder.

The code in this example is the same as in the [key verification tutorial](https://help.cryptolens.io/examples/key-verification).
